There be three categories of humans in the Adda, the main square of the marketplace that is also the bus terminus.

There are those who inhabit the Adda: the tailor stitching at his machine, the restaurant owner preparing thukpa, the idle shopkeeper sitting and chatting at another idle shopkeeper’s doorstep, the carpenters sawing their plywood to size, the taxi drivers beside their parked cars. They, like the rain-shelter, the drinking water tap and the small temple serve Purpose in the Adda.

For those of us unfamiliar with the faces of those who inhabit the Adda, it is only the arrival and imminent departure of a bus that brings into awareness the second category: those who, like the water gurgling down the roadside *kuhl*, are merely transiting through the Adda. The daughter of the tea shop owner is the only non-passenger who approaches the bus, she laughs as she gives the driver a message he will convey, like his passengers, to a destination. There exist many modes of transiting the Adda: the heavy jeeps and transport vehicles with their deep throated bellows, the more muted roars of passenger cars, the whirr of the scooters, the thumps of the Enfields. Some are tourists, asking for directions to the petrol pump, or waiting anxiously at an empty shop for the erstwhile idle shopkeeper to arrive from across the square. The largest number though pass through on foot, sometimes pausing for business, or for pleasure.

And then there are those whom the others call innocent. One is sweeping the fallen poplar leaves off the road, mumbling softly to himself; the other is holding a grilled sandwich, a bottle of Mirinda and a few sticks as he walks around foraging for more food. Like the dogs, these are the true landlords of their territory; they come and go as they please, getting what they need from the nature of what is around them, valuing little the pettiness that occupies others’ minds, leaving us wondering about the nature of their consciousnesses.
