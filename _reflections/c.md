A few observations from living in a rural space for a short while:

a) <ins>The corporeal</ins>: The body takes more of a beating - scratches, bruises, burns, etc.; maybe it teaches one to deal with pain without complaining about it. It also gets more exercise, and more rest. Perhaps it is this which results in the indefinable agelessness of the people around - it really isn't possible to tell their age, because there's a weatheredness in their handskin and faceskin, and a purity/unjadedness of youth deep within their eyes. 

b) <ins>Birdsound and silence</ins>: The rattling of a tractor trailer on kachcha roads lasts an eternity, fading into the distance until it idles coughingly at its destination over a hundred yards away, switches off and uncovers people's voices as they're discussing its contents. When someone is coming home, we hear their footsteps, the tinkling of the gate, and can tell who they are if they speak to a passerby. The buzzing of a fly, doppler style. The delicious gurgling of children's play, the lilting conversational murmur of adults, the plaintive mewling of a hungry cat. Clattering spoons, pots and pans in kitchens around. The compressor of the refrigerator.  The continuous birdsounds that frame the daytime silence, the crickets that do it at night.

c) <ins>Butterflies and fireflies, spirits and magic</ins>: Nature here appears to be more free, widespread. Open spaces are roamed by countless creatures interweaving gracefully, eating and being eaten. Who can really tell if the butterfly lives only for a day, for there are butterflies every day. There is time to watch a feather float down from a tree, smell the blades of grass being crushed underfoot, taste the cow in its milk. The unexpected is omnipresent, blurring the line that separates the magical from the real: the sudden shower that dissipates the afternoon heat, the stickiness on one's face that comes of walking through an invisible web, the ethereality of fireflies in a dark field. And there's a hunch that can't be shaken: that the spirits here are more powerful because the people believe in them more. 

d) <ins>The disconcerting value of money</ins>: A currency note certainly feels like it has more purchasing power: the cobbler charges Rs.50/- to double the lifetime of a shoe, skilled work that takes him almost an hour; a farmer sells five large radishes, fresh from his field, for Rs.20/-. While money is not a necessity for most residents' survival, for their self-sustaining and interdependent lifestyles that have evolved over generations take care of their basic needs, there is a bewitching access to convenience that it provides. Thus it transpires that many youth born here choose to spend their lives in urban spaces, where it's possible for them to earn more money than they would in this idyllic setting.
