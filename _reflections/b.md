On the first day of Hospice, the anaesthetist say to me: "Do you want to feel the ketamine shot?" My response: "It's an opportunity". He laughed, and then I got high.

On the second day of Hospice, the lady-lowest-in-hierarchy say to me: "Call and tell me each time the urinal is full". I do, as I get more proficient at using it.

On the third day of Hospice, my mama say to me: "If you don't use the bedpan, your faeces will get solid and someone will have to manipulate your rectum to get it out". But I can't wrap my mind around taking a dump, supine, in a plastic box placed under my butt, and then having someone else clean it, and me, up.

On the fourth day of Hospice the irony strike me: before I was here, my wife spent an hour-and-a-half each day administering medical care to me. Since I've been interred, the nurses spend forty seconds each day administering medical care to me - they remind me to take my pills.

On the fifth day of Hospice, it starts getting to me, all the cooping up and the too much TV. My hopes start hinging on being allowed to go, not home but just to the loo.

On the sixth day of Hospice the doctor do site inspection and say to me: "perish the thought of travelling". I'm filled with negativity, and realise that it's probably the shit that's accumulated inside me. 

On the seventh day of Hospice I want to pick fights: I make them fix my TV and door, and take a photo of my foot despite their objections.

On the eighth day of Hospice I am denied access to my file. The paternalism and inequality in the relationship are now painfully evident - the fear that the doctor will act against my best interests (getting out of here soon) if I in any way threaten his sense of security; I decide that forgiveness is the best way forward.

On the ninth day of Hospice the hospital fights back: my sheets and gown are not changed, the dustbin isn't emptied, the nurses squabble over who's supposed to (not) dress my foot, one doctor examines my foot and walks out without making any small talk, and the other offers to give me haloperidol to ease my mental state.

On the tenth day of Hospice we stay lost in our own worlds, not interfering with each other. They don't come to see me, and I don't expect anything from them.

On the eleventh day of Hospice I am set free from the confines of my bed. Overjoyed, my first act is to hobble to the bathroom and relieve myself. A huge bill is presented, and a huge discount is given.

On the twelfth day of Hospice I see the truth - that hospice is Hospice for a reason: when I am home, it isn't possible to rest my foot the way it's meant to be rested in order to facilitate the best healing.
