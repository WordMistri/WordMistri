I studied in a well-regarded English-medium school. Though I am comfortable speaking three other languages (two of which I am reasonably literate in), I am most fluent in English, and it is the only language in which I can truly appreciate aesthetic beauty. Yet, I am Indian. Fully, wholly, utterly. I have spent my life here, and cannot imagine wanting to live in another country.

I am certain I am not alone; that there exists, in the upper quartile of our economic pyramid, generations of Indians born in and after the seventies whose primary interface with the universe around them is in English. I was in a train when it first struck me: we ALL know what happened when Ross and Rachel were on a break! The very ‘language’ we speak is different; the ways in which we have learnt our language have exposed us to (and made us comfortable with) thoughts, ideas and mindsets that are quite alien to the ones that ‘Indian culture’ enjoins and creates in those who have not this exposure. Thus, we understand that Oscar nominated movies are usually good, that sexuality is a spectrum and that love, sex and marriage can be independent; that pasta and lasagna are different, but that Rs.10 crore and Rs.100 crore are not that different. 

We are tolerant, vibrant even, having grown up in a culture that accepted multiple cultures. This is a significant difference between our childhood and our children's; for they too grow up in an environment with more aspirations than inspirations, where it's normal to want that house and that car, and then that bigger house and those bigger cars. It is in the fulfilment of these aspirations that our cities are choking, in construction dust and auto fumes. It is to fuel our air-conditioners that fields have become reservoirs, and forests mines.

Knowingly or unknowingly, for better or for worse, our elders have made choices that have created this position. Which is where we are, in the prime of our lives, making choices every day, every moment. Are we conscious that we are choosing? Are the choices we are making responsible? Are we doing justice to our potential (given where we are in our country's socio-economic hierarchy) by giving ourselves the time and mindspace to think about our journeys?

For we exist, and it is we who are driving the country.
