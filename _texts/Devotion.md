- you think that
- for your appreciation
- i will jump through hoops?

- you are right.

- you think that
- the more you ignore me
- the harder i'll crave your attention?

- you are right. 

- you think that
- i am an instrument
- yours to twang as you please?

- you are right.

- but what makes you so sure?
- and what makes me so sure?
