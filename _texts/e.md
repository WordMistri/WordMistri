- There lies comfort in being in limbo,
- perhaps even joy and purpose,
- like the lord narasimha.

- not urban not rural
- not employed not jobless
- not rich not poor
- not english not vernacular
- not fitting in not left out.

- the comfort of not belonging to the prevailing mores
- the joy of ferreting out the flaws
- the purpose of just being different.
