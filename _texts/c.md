- there's this feeling of creeping-up madness
- in telugu it's described as pichchiekkuthundhi
- that it's climbing, slowly.

- crazy creeping upwards
- simmering looking left looking right
- sitting in the one spot 
- doing the herd thing
- excitable jumping at times 
- that the others learn to ignore (as if it will just go away, because they don't know how to react, whether the youthful freedom is to be encouraged or discouraged)
- lapsing into brooding
- until the next bout of exuberance is triggered by a call from the Real
- again dampened by reality 
- the spiral spring slowly winding up
- storing the unresolved unletout energy
- squeezing compressing the space closing in
- bouncing on the balls of my feet
- until the Snap
- of release. 

- and then the calm
- watching as the others deal with the mayhem unleashed, the beauty let loose.
