- They say that every seed is a promise 
- holding within it the story-potential of all that has come before it,
- and while every mighty oak was once an acorn, not all acorns become mighty oaks.

- They say that every grain of rice is inscribed with the name of its eater
- just as every brick knows where in the masonry it will rest -
- it's only a matter of passing time.

- They talk of a place of surrender where choice is an illusion,
- a burden carried by ego.
- And of a secret chord that vibrates through the universe 
- making self and nature one, making I one, being and becoming one.
