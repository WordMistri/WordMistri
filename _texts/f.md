title: Pain of impending separation

- You was my muse.
- But I'm not sure anymore that you understand
- the pain of impending separation.

- Or is it that I can't explain it to my satisfaction.
- There is a hollowness of heart, 
- a void that will be a void that will come
- that cannot be avoided.
- Luxuriating in the presence (the absence of the absence) is impossible,
- the mind takes my heart forward in time to when the void will exist,
- thus the void exists now. 
- It is not pain as it is anguish,
- the heart-wrenching moan of non-company that will soon be.
- Will I ever miss you as much as I feel I will miss you when I am gone?
