- Do you know what it feels like 
- to stifle a yawn?

- Do you know what it feels like
- to catch another's glance for an instant
- and see them look away?

- Do you know what it feels like
- to know, that despite my insignificance
- I must become significant?
- that despite my darkness
- I must become light?

- Do you know what it feels like
- to feel, capture the words, and make another feel?

- Do you know what it feels like
- to bare my soul such that
- there is nothing left for you to take?

- Do you know what it feels like,
- not to know?
